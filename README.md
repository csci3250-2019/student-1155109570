# Hi
I am **Cheng Yun Chuen, Ray.**

I have skipped many class so I am not a good developer and have never been using GitHub before.
(But I have attended all lectures of CSCI3250/1, so please dont drop a _F-Bomb_ (Fail-Bomb I mean) on me.  

Hence, I have no idea what is going on here.

It seems that I need to fulfil different requirements.
The next requirement is list so i am now going to list my favourite fruits.

**My favourite fruits:**
1. Banana (It is convenient to eat)
1. Grapes (Also convenient to eat, but **eat 1 banana = eat N grape (where N>1)** so banana has a higher cp-value)
1. Apple (My gum bleeds every time when I eat apple)
1. Orange (It is annoying to peel an orange)

OK, I am reaching the end.

**Required styling elements:**
- [x] Header
- [x] Emphasis
- [x] List (any kind)
- [x] Task List
- [ ] Table

**So the last thing is table:**

First Header | Second Header
| ------------ | ------------ 
| Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
| Content in the first column  | Content in the second column

I can't think of another topic for the table so I directly copy the one in the guide.
Here's the reference: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

If you have read until here, I am sorry that you have wasted your precious time. Bye!
